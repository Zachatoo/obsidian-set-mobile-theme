## Set Mobile Theme – Obsidian Plugin 📱
*Set Mobile Theme* is a simple but powerful plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

> 🚧 Status: Available through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

### Features
This plugin allows you to set a separate theme for desktop and mobile use. This is handy when you [sync](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-syncing-between-devices/20983) your entire vault between your phone and your desktop but want to have different themes.
